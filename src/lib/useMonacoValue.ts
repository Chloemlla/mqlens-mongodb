/**
 * Keeps a Monaco editor's text in step with a React value, in place of
 * @monaco-editor/react's `value` prop.
 *
 * The library compares `value` with the model from a passive effect. Chromium
 * delivers Monaco's typing through EditContext events, which React doesn't
 * treat as discrete, so the render an onChange causes has its passive effects
 * run in a later task, and the next keystroke can reach the model first. The
 * library then wrote the previous keystroke's text over it: characters vanished
 * and the caret jumped to the end. This writes the value from a layout effect
 * instead, in the same task as the render, before any further input can land.
 *
 * Spread the result onto the editor: `defaultValue` in place of `value`, and
 * `onChange` and `onMount` as given. Call `onMount` from an editor's own mount
 * handler when it has one.
